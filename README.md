# 🚀 Space Coffee Co. Checkout System

---

## Instructions for use

To run the Space Coffee Co. Checkout System run the following commands in the root directory of the project. Note: you will need to open up a second terminal to run `npm start`, as you will want to leave the server runner.

```
npm install
npm run server
npm start
```

After running `npm start` your default browser should automatically open up to the Checkout System.

Input your card information, submit your card, then you can process your payment.

Congratulations! You've checked out and purchased your first space coffee! It will be waiting for you on Mars!

Welcome, brave developer! The year is 2124, and Space Coffee Co. needs YOUR help! We're the premier coffee delivery service in the solar system, but our checkout system is stuck in the 21st century. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to help us modernize our payment system so we can continue serving the best coffee from Earth to Mars and beyond! ☕️

## 🎯 Mission Objectives

Your task is to create a simple but modern checkout system for Space Coffee Co. with the following specifications:

1. Create a web application that renders a sleek checkout page
2. Integrate the PublicSquare payment form for secure credit/debit card transactions
3. Handle the form submission to create a card in our system
4. Process the payment through our secure galactic payment network

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

- Use any programming languages and frameworks of your choice
- Integrate PublicSquare Elements SDK following our [card collection guide](https://developers.publicsquare.com/guides/merchants/collect-cards)
- Process payments using our [payment processing guide](https://developers.publicsquare.com/guides/merchants/process-payments)
- Ensure the solution works across all Earth-based browsers (and maybe some Martian ones too! 👽)

## 🌟 Bonus Points

While not required, we'd be impressed by:

- Clean, well-organized code
- Basic error handling
- A touch of space-themed styling
- A simple success/failure message after payment

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Set up your preferred development environment
3. Follow the PublicSquare documentation to implement the payment form
4. Create an awesome checkout experience!

## 🎭 Test Data

For testing, you can use these galactic-approved test card numbers:

- Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- Any future expiration date

You'll need to create a PSQ account at https://portal.publicsquare.com and grab your Public/Secret keys from https://portal.publicsquare.com/developers/api-keys

## 🌍 Mission Control

Remember: This is a prototype, so focus on the core functionality. We're looking for clean, working code that demonstrates your ability to integrate third-party APIs and create a seamless user experience.

Good luck, developer! The future of interplanetary coffee commerce rests in your capable hands! 🚀
